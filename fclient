Create an interface
@FeignClient("PlanMS")
public interface CustPlanFeign {
	@RequestMapping(value="/plans/{planId}")
	PlanDTO getSpecificPlan(@PathVariable("planId") int planId);
	
}
The interface must be annotated with @FeignClient and must mention the service name for which we are writing the Feign Client.

We need not provide an implementation for this interface. The framework will provide a dynamic implementation at run time.

Autowire the feign client as:    

@Autowired
    CustPlanFeign planFeign;
 

Invoke the plan microservice as 

planFeign.getSpecificPlan(planId);
